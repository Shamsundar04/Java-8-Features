	In Java, every interface implicitly inherits the Object class methods
	 (like toString(), equals(), hashCode(), etc.), even though you don’t write extends Object.
	
	🔎 Why?
	
	All classes in Java extend Object directly or indirectly.
	
	When a class implements an interface, it still extends Object, so methods of Object are always available.
	
	That’s why an interface doesn’t need to explicitly declare those methods.
