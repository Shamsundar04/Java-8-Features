->	Multiple inheritance is possible in java by using default method inside an interface,
		here we need to use super keyword to differenciate the super interface methods.
->	Before java 1.8, we have abstract method inside an interface but now we can write method body(default method)
		so, to execute the default method inside an interface we need to take super keyword with 
		interface name (A.super.m1()).
->	Whenever a class is implementing from two OR more than two super interafecs and If the interfaces
		are containing same default method name then we have an ambiguity issue so, compulsory we need to override default method.
